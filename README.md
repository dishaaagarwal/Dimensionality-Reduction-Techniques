# Dimensionality-Reduction-Techniques
In this repository I have implemented various Dimensionality-Reduction-Techniques.

## Main Aim
The main objective of this repository is to try Hands-On implementation of Dimensionality-Reduction-Techniques. I have implemented PCA & LDA in this repository


## PCA

- **PCA from stratch using Python**

- **PCA using sklearn**


- **PCA  with ML algorithm**

![](/images/PCA_4.png)  Test Data


- **Hyperparameter Tuning for PCA**

- **Kernel PCA**

## LDA

- **Fit the Data for LDA**
- **Logistic Regression using LDA**
- 
While using LDA with Linear algorithm I was able to achieve an accuracy of  train data=**98%**  test data=**94%**
-

- **SVM using LDA**
- 
While using LDA with non-Linear algorithm I was able to achieve an accuracy of  train data=**100%**  test data=**100%**
